Several trade-in requests are failing with this error: 'Validation failed: Invalid trade-in request. Missing required parameters.' Customers are unable to complete trade-ins. Can someone help?\n \nSophia (Frontend Developer): Hey Mike, I checked our frontend. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed anything related to trade-ins recently. Is this happening for all trade-ins or only specific cases?\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconsistent. Some trade-ins are working fine, while others fail. Logs show failures mostly for certain device models. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sample request that failed: { 'tradeInId': '12345', 'customerId': '98765', 'deviceModel': 'XYZ-Pro', 'tradeInValue': 300 }\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check recent backend changes. Give me a few minutes.\n\nSophia (Frontend Developer): I ran a few test cases. Some models fail, others go through. This seems model-specific.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Yeah, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I noticed too. James, anything from the backend side?\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Found it! A recent update added a new validation rule requiring 'deviceCondition'. Requests without this field are failing. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t communicated to the frontend team.\n\nSophia (Frontend Developer): Ah, that explains it. Our requests don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include 'deviceCondition', which is why they fail.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): So the root cause is a new required field introduced without updating the API contract? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest fix?\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Yes, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the root cause. The fastest fix is to make 'deviceCondition' optional for now. I'll deploy a hotfix immediately.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Great! Will this fix all failing requests instantly?\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Yes, once deployed, trade-ins will process as before, even if 'deviceCondition' is missing. Frontend team should update their requests in the future to include it.\n\nSophia (Frontend Developer): Got it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll add it to our backlog and update the API documentation.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Thanks, everyone! Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s document this properly to prevent future issues.\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Hotfix deployed. Trade-ins should be working again. Can someone confirm?\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Just tested\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtrade-ins are successful now! \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u20ac Closing the issue. Thanks, team!\n\nSophia (Frontend Developer): Lesson learned: always communicate API changes. \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2026\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): For sure! I'll add a test case to catch similar issues before release."

        "Conversation":"Mike (Production Support Engineer): Hey team, we have a critical issue! Some orders are getting cancelled, but the CLNR (Certified Like New Replacement) returns are still showing as outstanding. This is causing discrepancies in our system. Can someone help investigate?\n\nSophia (Order Management Developer): Hey Mike, are these cases happening across all orders or specific ones?\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): From what I see, it's mostly affecting replacement orders where the customer cancels the order after requesting a CLNR return.\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Let me check the order cancellation workflow and see if the CLNR status is being updated correctly.\n\nSophia (Order Management Developer): I'll check our frontend logic as well to ensure we're sending the right cancellation request.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): I pulled some logs from Kibana. Here's an example where an order was cancelled, but the CLNR status remains 'Pending Return': { \"orderId\": \"56789\", \"status\": \"Cancelled\", \"clnrStatus\": \"Pending Return\" }\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): I found the issue! When an order is cancelled, we update the order status, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not triggering the workflow that updates CLNR returns. The process is still expecting the customer to return the old device.\n\nSophia (Order Management Developer): That makes sense! The cancellation process should also mark the CLNR return as 'Not Required' if the order is cancelled before return completion.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): So, the root cause is that the CLNR return process is not being notified when an order is cancelled?\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Exactly! The order cancellation event is not linked to the CLNR return status update. We need to add a trigger that marks outstanding CLNR returns as 'Not Required' when an order is cancelled.\n\nSophia (Order Management Developer): What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fastest fix for this?\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): I'll push a hotfix to update the cancellation workflow so that CLNR returns get closed when an order is cancelled.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Will this resolve existing outstanding CLNR returns too?\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Yes, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also run a script to update any old orders that are in 'Cancelled' status but still have outstanding CLNR returns.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Awesome! Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s make sure we document this fix so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen again.\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Hotfix deployed! CLNR returns will now be properly marked as 'Not Required' when an order is cancelled. I also ran the cleanup script.\n\nMike (Production Support Engineer): Just tested it\u00e2\u20ac\u201deverything is working fine now! Thanks, everyone!\n\nSophia (Order Management Developer): Great work! Lesson learned\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalways sync order cancellations with all related workflows.\n\nJames (Backend Engineer): Agreed!
